## Transform (Power Query Editor)
* Transform used to preprocess data before using for analysis, like-
    * **Split Column by Delimiter:**
        * Select/enter delimiter: `Tab`
        * Split at: `Each occurance of the delimiter`
        * Split into: `Columns`
        * `Don't change the value of "Number of columns to split into"`
    * **Make first row as header**
    * **Apply and close**
